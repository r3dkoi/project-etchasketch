1. Creating the 16x16 grid
    - Apparently have to make it into a nested loop
    - Using for loop    
        - Outer loop = 16 times iteration for the rows
        - Inner loop = 16 times iteration for the columns

CREATE FOR 
    SET rows to 0
    CONDITION rows LESS than 16
    INCREMENT rows by 1
    // outer loop for rows


        CREATE another FOR inside rows loop
            SET columns to 0
            CONDITION columns LESS than 16
            INCREMENT columns by 1
                    CREATE div element here
                    APPEND div to container
            ENDFOR
ENDFOR
