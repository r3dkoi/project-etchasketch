1. Creating the 16x16 grid
    - Apparently have to make it into a nested loop
    - Using for loop    
        - Outer loop = 16 times iteration for the rows
        - Inner loop = 16 times iteration for the columns

CREATE FOR 
    SET rows to 0
    CONDITION rows LESS than 16
    INCREMENT rows by 1
    // outer loop for rows


        CREATE another FOR inside the rows loop
            SET columns to 0
            CONDITION columns LESS than 16
            INCREMENT columns by 1
                    SET div TO createElement("div");
                    APPEND div to container
            ENDFOR
ENDFOR

- Had to research about DOMContentLoaded .addEventListener here
- 


2. Using Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid
    - Probably adjust the border of each first to see how they all look.
        - Use CSS to edit the div elements inside the .container
        - Find a way to rename the "div"s made inside the javascript so its easier
            for me to target?
            - Yeah I did actually have to do this lol
            - Have to use div.classList.add() to add another reference to the div.
                - Nah I dont need to do that, I can just target the "div" element, but I gotta check if it affects the .container div too
            - Finished the 16x16 grid but the grid looks really big in general
            - if I wanted to make it smaller I'm pretty sure I cant make it 16x16 lol

3. Hover effect
    - I definitely need to do the document.AddEventListener thing here 
    - Need to research how to:
    "There are multiple ways to change the color of the divs, including:
Adding a new class to the div.
Changing the divâ€™s background color using JavaScript."
    -  WOW I REALLY NEEDED TO JUST... CHANGE THE BACKGROUND LMFAO NOT COLOR.
    - Maybe math.floor()and then math.random? choose between an array of colours.
    - I don't think I need to loop here, do I?
    - I can start off simple, just with a single colour.
    - div.setAttribute("color: red)
    - i also need to append this dont i?
    - New addEventListener function I learned today:
        - hover = mouseover
    - document. will target the entire document, while container.addEventListener
        - only adds an event to the .container. so gotta remember that its not always .document
        - it can literally be any class or id I can attach a eventlistener too.

4. This section is about adding a button at the top of the
    screen, the user will be asked to input the no. of squares per side
        for the new grid. The number inputted will replace the old grid, with the new grid size.
        This generates a brand new sketch pad in general.

  - CREATE button in HTML file with class 'reset'
    - in JS 
        TARGET button 'reset'
            INSIDE reset 
                SET userRowsInput to PROMPT user 'How many rows do you want your sketchpad to have?'
                SET userColumnsInput to PROMPT user 'How many columns do you want your sketchpad to have?'
                
                SET userRows to PARSEINT(userRowsInput) with a base of 10. 
                SET userColumns to PARSEINT(userColumnsInput) with a base of 10.
                //checks if user input is a valid number

                IF 
                    userRows IS NOT A NUMBER
                    OR 
                    userColumns IS NOT A NUMBER
                    OR 
                    userRows is GREATER THAN a 100
                    OR 
                    userColumns is GREATER THAN a 100
                    ALERT user "Please enter valid numbers that less than or equal to 100."
                      // checks if user input's integers is limited to 100
                    ELSE 
                        ALERT user "Generating a new sketchpad by + userRows + "x" + userColumns +."
                            //concatenating them with + because its not a string anymore. `` used for strings.
                         SET container.innerHTML to "" // this clears the old sketchpad
                        FOR 
                            SET userRows to 0 // user input
                            CONDITION userRows to LESS THAN userRows // user input
                            INCREMENT by 1
                            // rows generation
                            FOR 
                                SET userColumns to 0
                                CONDITION userColumns to LESS THAN userColumns
                                INCREMENT by 1
                                    SET div to document.createElement("div")
                                    ADD grid-item to div
                                    APPEND div to container
                            ENDFOR
                        ENDFOR
