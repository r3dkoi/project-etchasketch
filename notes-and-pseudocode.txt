1. Creating the 16x16 grid
    - Apparently have to make it into a nested loop
    - Using for loop    
        - Outer loop = 16 times iteration for the rows
        - Inner loop = 16 times iteration for the columns

CREATE FOR 
    SET rows to 0
    CONDITION rows LESS than 16
    INCREMENT rows by 1
    // outer loop for rows


        CREATE another FOR inside the rows loop
            SET columns to 0
            CONDITION columns LESS than 16
            INCREMENT columns by 1
                    SET div TO createElement("div");
                    APPEND div to container
            ENDFOR
ENDFOR

- Had to research about DOMContentLoaded .addEventListener here
- 


2. Using Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid
    - Probably adjust the border of each first to see how they all look.
        - Use CSS to edit the div elements inside the .container
        - Find a way to rename the "div"s made inside the javascript so its easier
            for me to target?
                - Nah I dont need to do that, I can just target the "div" element, but I gotta check if it affects the .container div too
            - Finished the 16x16 grid but the grid looks really big in general
            - if I wanted to make it smaller I'm pretty sure I cant make it 16x16 lol

3. Hover effect
    - I definitely need to do the document.AddEventListener thing here 
    - Need to research how to:
    "There are multiple ways to change the color of the divs, including:
Adding a new class to the div.
Changing the divâ€™s background color using JavaScript."
    - Maybe math.floor()and then math.random? choose between an array of colours.
    - I don't think I need to loop here, do I?
    - I can start off simple, just with a single colour.
